-Report timing comments:
The Timing report show the Enable signal of Latch (OUTALE[3]/G) getting
triggered by the rise, and after 60 ps, at the falling, the OUT signal
(OUTALU[3]) become equal to the IN signal (OUTALU[3]/Q).
 
-Report area comments:
The Area report show the description of the circuit (number of cells, ports
ecc).  A significative data is the number of combinational (86) and sequential
(4) cells, with the respectiveves areas (96.824 nm and 10.64 nm, with a total
of 107.464 nm). 
The 4 sequential cells check-out since the only sequential logic of the entity
is the 4 bit register necessary to store the output.
