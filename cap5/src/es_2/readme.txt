Q2: Try to explain the different behavior of the currents when changing the load, and especially the different
    contribution among Vdd current, Gnd current and Cload current in the various transition cases.

A2: The different behaviour of the currents is due to the changing of equivalent
    resistance of the circuit for different load values. The general behaviour of
    I_vdd and I_gnd is the same but with opposite trends: In I_vdd, by decreasing
    cload, the current peak during the falling edge increases, while the current
    peak during the rising edge decreases. The beahaviour of I_gnd is the opposite,
    with a decreasing rising edge peak and increasing I_gnd peak.  I_c is directly
    proportional to the capacity of the load.
