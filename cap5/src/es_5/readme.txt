Q4: Compare these results with those obtained from the two previous gates, as well by superposing the four
    waveforms. Whatâ€™s happening to the delay? What about the current? Which is the percentage of
    advantage and/or disadvantage in using the LL gates with respect to the HS ones?

A4: There are a differences in power and delay that amount to 20% between HS and LL circuit.
    Obviously in LL the consumption is lower and, as a result, the delay is larger.
