Q: How does the timing report change with respect to the one obtained from the previous structure?
A: The timing delay greatly increased when compared to ex. 3.1.2. This is
because of a few reasons: the added complexity of the windowing system impacts
the delay, since the critical path now travels through the control unit and one
address decoder, moreover the morphology of the synthesized register file has
changed (5 32 bit registers vs 20 8 bit registers), increasing the delay from
0.09 to 0.50.
